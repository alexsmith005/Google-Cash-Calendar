# Google-Cash-Calendar
Creates a real time cash flow manager that interacts with Google Calendars.

This Application uses OAuth Authentication to access your Google Calendars.
It then creates a new calendar where you can add Income and Expense events, either as single events or recurring.
You will be prompted for your starting cash, and the application will use that number, along with the events you created to keep a running Cash Flow total.

In order to create new events, the title must either be "Income" or "Expense" without the quotations.
The body of the event must have the number to be added or subtracted and nothing else.

It's a simple application that I'm looking to add more functionality to over time.
